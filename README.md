# nvim
Nvim personal configuration

The inspiration for this configs comes from [THIS VIDEO](https://youtu.be/vdn_pKJUda8).

Most of the configruations are taken from that video but I added some personal preferences.
If you want a full explanation of the code please check the video.

I'm quite new to the world of vim and nvim but if this file can help you feel free to use it.

I created this repo just to have all those configs available everywhere and to set up easely new computers.
